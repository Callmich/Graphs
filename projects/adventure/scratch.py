Understand:


My Plan:
create a dictionary of 500 rooms 0 - 499 with an exmple being - 0: {'n': '?', 's': '?', 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}

have player enter starting room and check the exits
    if an exit in a direction does not exist it removes it from the string ***** potentially break up the string into a list or list of lists.
